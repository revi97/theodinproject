# odin-recipes
HTML  project to make a recipe website as a part of THE ODIN PROJECT

The recipe is taken from allrecipes.com

A new image was added to the site with the proper recipe for the same.

Added the ingredients as checkable items so as to anyone can check them out and no need to remember what is remaining to be bought.

Centered the whole page as much as possible by giving a padding to the side.
